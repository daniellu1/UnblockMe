# UnblockMe
Classic Klotski Puzzle (ie. Unblock Me) game implemented through hardware via Verilog and ARM Assembly.

VERILOG: 
The goal of our project was to recreate the game “Unblock Me:” a puzzle game wherein the player slides vertical and horizontal
obstacle blocks to create a clear path for a red block to slide across the screen to an exit. 

ASSEMBLY: 
•	Puzzle game whose premise is to slide blocks around to get a specially-coloured block out of the board to an exit.
•	Use FPGA SW[9:0] to select which block to move. 
•	Use FPGA KEY[3:0] to move the selected block up/down/left/right. 
•	Features: different difficulties, timer, number of moves so far, etc.
•	Concepts: C programming; ARM interrupts.
